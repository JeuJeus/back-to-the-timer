# Back to the Timer
This is a hacked out Prototype. 
Do not expect to much...

## Usage
Use the ``destinationTime`` Query Parameter to inject destinationTime as Unix timestamp.
Refer to [this Builder](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) for creating timestamps.

### Example
The timestamp _1055408381_
corresponds to **Thu Jun 12 2003 10:59:41 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)**.
